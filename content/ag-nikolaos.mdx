I had a conversation with the board members (all women) of the cultural centre of Agios Nikolaos, a village which is located in the estuary of the river. They described the first days of the floods and mainly how they supported the local community, with basic supplies and food. I presented myself and the project to the representative of the local community, Panagiotis Limperis.
