**Eretria** is a town, 13 km from the Lilandio plain. Eretria is connected by ferry with Oropos (Skala), the town I live in. I visited and interviewed a very active group of firefighters and rescuers volunteers. This group of volunteers offered its services straight away after the flood in August 2020.
