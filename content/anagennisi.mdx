This cultural centre is also in Agios Nikolaos village in the Burtzi area, located between the river and the sea. We talked about the impact of the flood and exchanged ideas regarding a participatory project. We decided to produce collaboratively with members of the centre and the community a wall painting. They expressed their need to offer some activity and social interaction with the elderly and explained that during the winter time people feel isolated.
